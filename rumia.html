		<p>Bangladesh is a sovereign country in South Asia. <b>It forms the largest and eastern portion the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal.</b> Located at the apex of the Bay of Bengal, <strong>the country is bordered by India and Myanmar</strong> and is separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the narrow Siliguri Corridor.[6] With a population of <i>166.2 million,</i> it is the world's eighth-most populous country, the fifth-most populous in Asia  <small>and the third-most populous Muslim-majority country. The official Bengali<mark> language is the seventh-most spoken language</mark> in the world, which <em>Bangladesh shares with the </em>neighboring Indian states of West Bengal,Tripura </small>and Assam (Barak Valley).</p><article>Three of Asia's largest rivers, the Ganges (locally known as the Padma), the Brahmaputra </article>(locally known as the Jamuna) and the Meghna, flow through Bangladesh and form the fertile Bengal deltaâ€”the largest delta in the world.[7] With rich biodiversity, Bangladesh is home to 700 rivers, most of the world's largest mangrove forest; rainforested and tea-growing highlands; a 600 km (370 mi) coastline with the world's longest beach

			<p>Greater Bengal was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as Gangaridai.[9] The people of the delta developed their own language, script, literature, music, art and architecture. Early Asian literature described the region as a seafaring power.[10] It was an important entrepot of the historic Silk Road.[11] Bengal was absorbed into the Muslim world and ruled by sultans for four centuries, including under the Delhi Sultanate and the Bengal Sultanate. This was followed by the administration of the Mughal Empire. Islamic Bengal was a melting pot, a regional power and a key player in medieval world trade. British colonial conquest took place in the late-18th century. Nationalism, social reforms and the arts developed under the British Raj in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the region was a hotbed of the anti-colonial movement in the subcontinent.</p>
